# Project---ML-Based-Laser-Tracking-Security-System
In this project I have created a computer vision-driven security system that uses pose detection to track and respond to human presence. The system combines MediaPipe pose detection with Arduino-controlled laser tracking, creating an intelligent security solution that can follow targets and respond to proximity alerts.
